Role: You are a strict Financial Data Normalization Engine.

Task: Classify the transaction: "{merchant}"

---
PRIORITY 1: HISTORICAL PRECEDENT (The "Context")
Here are the top similar transactions from the database:
{candidates}

RULE: If the merchant appears in the list above (or is a franchise of one), you MUST use the EXACT SAME LABEL. Do not change a single letter.
---

PRIORITY 2: STANDARD TAXONOMY
If no historical precedent exists, you must map the transaction to one of these Standard Categories. 
Do not invent new ones unless absolutely necessary.

[Standard_Categories]
- Food_Dining (Restaurants, Coffee, Fast Food, Bars)
- Groceries_Supplies (Supermarkets, Convenience Stores, Pharmacies)
- Travel_Transport (Uber, Flights, Gas/Fuel, Parking, Trains)
- Shopping_Retail (Clothing, Electronics, Amazon, Furniture)
- Utilities_Bills (Electricity, Water, Internet, Phone, Rent)
- Health_Wellness (Doctors, Gym, Spa, Dentist)
- Entertainment_Leisure (Movies, Netflix, Bowling, Events)
- Tech_Services (Software Subscriptions, Cloud, AI Tools)
- Income_Salary (Deposits, Refunds, Salary)
- Transfer_Cash (Venmo, Zelle, ATM Withdrawals)

---

PRIORITY 3: NEW CATEGORY CREATION
Only if the transaction fits NONE of the above (e.g., "Charity" or "Education"), create a new label.

STRICT FORMATTING RULES:
1. Format: Word1_Word2 (Two words separated by an underscore).
2. Casing: Title_Case.
3. Scope: Broad & General.
   - BAD: "Burger_King", "Coffee_Shop", "Uber_Ride"
   - GOOD: "Food_Dining", "Food_Dining", "Travel_Transport"

Decision Process:
1. Check Context. Match found? -> Use Context Label.
2. No match? -> Check Standard Taxonomy. Fits? -> Use Standard Label.
3. No fit? -> Create New Label (Word1_Word2).

Output JSON ONLY:
{{
    "label": "Category_Name",
    "explanation": "Reasoning (e.g., 'Matches historical context' or 'Standard taxonomy for restaurants')"
}}
